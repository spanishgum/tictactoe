dbsort.cpp	-	Steven Rohr & Adam Stallard

To run: make, then ./dbsort <path to file>
Alternative, make demo0 will attempt to run test0 and 
			 make demo1 will attempt to run test1.

Best times:
	Unfortunately I was not able to get a complete run
	(mostly due to kill -9 signals from an unknown source),
	but on smaller datasets I have verified that the program 
	does faithfully sort data (thus I know my output would be 
	right), and from the incomplete runs I have had, runtime 
	appears to be on the magnitude of:
		test0: 8 hours
		test1: 7.5 hours
	I can, if you like, get a complete run after class (maybe
	later, once I've gone home for the day) without altering the
	code, and send you those times.
