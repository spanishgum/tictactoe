*  This unit of code will be used to interpret input and output.
*
*  The server will send a top lvl parser some user input and
*   the parser will respond with the type of request that was
*   sent, or possible error msgs.
*
*  After recieving the interpretation, the server will call the
*   appropriate functions which will handle contiguos input
*   and output until the request is fully satisfied.
